This week I couldn't really find something to do with the actual server. Some suggestions on what to toy around
using node would be nice if it's not too much trouble. What I ended up doing was making a different
version of the button thing I made last week. This one is definetely more interesting not only to use,
but to make. The main problem with it is that it does nothing with the actual server, I am perceftly aware of
this, but I again, I don't know what I could add to the server itself. But in the meantime, enjoy pressing a
button repetedly about 20 times to know what it will display next.
